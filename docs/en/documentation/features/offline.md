## Offline use

The **Geotrek-mobile** app offers full functionality even without an Internet connection, thanks to the ability to download hikes directly to the device.

### Downloading and viewing a trek

Once a trek has been downloaded to the smartphone or tablet, the user can:

* Access **all information** just like in online mode (detailed sheets, maps, photos, elevation profile, etc.)
* **View the trek map** and navigate along the track
* **Use the deviceâ€™s GPS** to locate themselves and follow the trek
* Receive **notifications** when approaching a point of interest (if previously enabled)
* Enjoy **all app features**, except for **URL sharing**, which requires an Internet connection

This mode is especially useful in areas with limited network coverage or when trekking in remote locations.
