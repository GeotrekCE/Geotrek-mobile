# What is Geotrek?

Geotrek is a suite of web tools dedicated to the **management and promotion** of trekking, outdoor sports, and tourism-related information.

These tools are open source, meaning they can be freely deployed by any organization or territory wishing to use them. They can also be customized, improved, or benefit from enhancements made by other users—without needing to finance them again.

Geotrek enables the management of **many outdoor sports practices** related to linear paths (hiking, cycling, mountain biking, horseback riding, stroller-friendly routes, etc.) as well as **non-linear outdoor content** (rock climbing, paragliding, white-water sports, etc.).

It is the **reference application** used by natural parks, as well as many public institutions (departmental councils, groups of municipalities, regional tourism boards, tourist offices, etc.).

**Using Geotrek will allow you to**:

* join a **highly active community** of trek managers
* **benefit from all updates and improvements** contributed by other users — the project is actively maintained and constantly evolving
* have access to a **comprehensive solution** that can also be used by other local stakeholders
* easily **unlock new features** as your needs grow: website, printable route sheets, signage management, maintenance and work planning…
* **export your enriched content** (routes, POIs, tourist information, etc.) to other **national tourism platforms** (IGNrando’, Visorando, Outdooractive, Apidae, Cirkwi, etc.)
